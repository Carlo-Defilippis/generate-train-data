Smith, responded to an incident at the intersection of Cummins Highway and Hollingsworth Street involving a vehicle stop (VALs) resulting in the arrest of Michael J. Thompson for four outstanding warrants, refusal to submit, and possible warrant violations. \n\nUpon arrival at the scene, I observed a blue sedan, MA REG: CHF-987, parked at the intersection. The driver, later identified as Michael J. Thompson, was seated behind the wheel. Thompson initially provided officers with the name \"John Doe\" but did not reveal his true identity until after he was arrested and transported to B3 for booking. Despite providing incorrect identification, Thompson had previously furnished his correct date of birth (05/12/1987) and Social Security number under the alias prior to being taken into custody.\n\nDuring the stop, Thompson stated that the vehicle belonged to a friend and was rented under someone else's name. However, when the registered owner, Sarah A. Johnson (previous failures to appear), arrived on scene, she was unable to produce a valid rental agreement or proof of ownership. As a result, the vehicle was towed. During an inventory search, officers discovered that the center console could be easily manipulated, revealing a large void space.\n\nCitations for VALs were issued via MACCS. There is nothing further to report."

Upon arriving at the scene, I observed a gray Acura TSX parked in front of Landing Street with two individuals inside the vehicle. I identified one male subject as Gabriel Maldonado, who is known to associate with the \"Landing Crew\" gang and has an extensive criminal history, including firearm violations, assault to murder, and armed robbery with a firearm.\n\nEarlier, on January 2, 2024, at around 9:23 p.m., officers encountered multiple subjects associated with the \"Landing Crew\" members at the same location. The gathering was identified as a mourning event for the mother of one of the members who had recently passed away. During that interaction, officers were able to identify several individuals, including Maldonado and another subject named Carlos Guichard. The encounter remained passive with no further incidents.\n\nUpon arriving on January 3, I noted that the vehicle was occupied by two males who appeared to be in their late twenties or early thirties. I approached the vehicle and requested identification from both subjects. Maldonado provided his valid Massachusetts ID, while Guichard stated he did not have any form of identification on him. I conducted a background check on Guichard and found no outstanding warrants at that time.\n\nI observed that the vehicle was registered to a third party and appeared to be in good working condition. There were no visible signs of damage or illegal substances inside the vehicle during my initial assessment. The subjects remained cooperative throughout the encounter, and there were no indications of immediate threat or criminal activity beyond their known associations.\n\nThe area around Border Street was quiet, with minimal foot traffic at that time. I smelled a faint odor of cologne from the vehicle but detected no signs of alcohol or narcotics. Both subjects spoke calmly and respectfully when addressed, and their demeanor did not indicate any signs of intoxication or aggression.\n\nAfter completing the necessary checks and documentation, I allowed both subjects to leave the scene without further incident. The investigation remains open for any additional developments, though no immediate action was taken at that time.\n\nThere is nothing further to report."
