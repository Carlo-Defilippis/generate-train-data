        "Narrative": "On January 1, 2024, at approximately 10:57 AM, I responded to an incident involving a failure to stop on Blue Hill Avenue where a Massachusetts State Trooper was struck by a vehicle. \n\nI received notification from Boston Police Channel 4 Operations regarding the incident and proceeded with my partner to assist in apprehending the suspect. En route, we were informed by Sergeant D.T. Krause that the suspect was observed traveling towards Dedham, MA, near Legacy Place.\n\nUpon arriving in Dedham, we were directed to the Holiday Inn, where the suspect was reported to be on foot. Observing a male matching the suspect's description, we approached the hotel and located him attempting to flee on the second floor.\n\nWe drew our firearms and ordered the suspect to the ground, securing him with handcuffs without resistance. A search revealed a Massachusetts driver's license in his possession, identifying him as Ethan Carter, born December 15, 1987. Carter had prior charges including firearm offenses and assault.\n\nCustody was transferred to Massachusetts State Police, and our Body-Worn Camera (BWC) was activated throughout the encounter.\n\nThere is nothing further to report."
